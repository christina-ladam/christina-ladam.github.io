    "text": "I am an assistant professor in the political science department at the University of Nevada, Reno. I study American political behavior, with research interests in deliberation, political discussion, and political psychology. I have additional research interests in state and local politics, and women and politics. I also study political methodology, with specific interests in experiments and social network analysis. My work has been published in the American Journal of Political Science, the Journal of Experimental Political Science, and PS: Political Science and Politics.\nI am co-director of the Nevada Election Survey Project, which conducts original surveys of Nevadans about their political and policy views.\nI am Associate Organizer of the Junior Americanist Workshop Series (JAWS). This virtual workshop, which began during the COVID-19 pandemic, provides junior scholars of American politics an opportunity to receive feedback on their work from top scholars in their fields."
