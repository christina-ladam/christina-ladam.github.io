## **Welcome!**

I am an assistant professor in the political science department at the University of Nevada, Reno. I study American political behavior, with research interests in deliberation, political discussion, and political psychology. I have additional research interests in state and local politics, and women and politics. I also study political methodology, with specific interests in experiments and social network analysis. My work has been published in the *American Journal of Political Science*, the *Journal of Experimental Political Science*, and *PS: Political Science and Politics*.

I am co-director of the [Nevada Election Survey Project](nvelectionsurvey.com), which conducts original surveys of Nevadans about their political and policy views.

I am Associate Organizer of the [Junior Americanist Workshop Series (JAWS)](https://jawspolisci.network/). This virtual workshop, which began during the COVID-19 pandemic, provides junior scholars of American politics an opportunity to receive feedback on their work from top scholars in their fields.
