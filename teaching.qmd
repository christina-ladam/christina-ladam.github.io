I have over nine years of teaching experience, and teach classes in both American politics and methodology. In the 2021-2022 academic year, I completed the Community Engaged Teaching training at UNR. I am a Faculty Fellow with the Educational Network for Active Civic Transformation (ENACT), at Brandeis University. Using these trainings, I have developed a service learning course on state politics where students lobby members of the state legislature on current legislation under consideration.
